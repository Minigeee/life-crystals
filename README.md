# Life Crystals

A small mod that adds life crystals that can be used to increase max health.

Life crystals can be crafted using life crystal shards, which can be found by mining life crystal ore.
This ore has the same generation behavior as diamond, but with slightly less quantity per vein.
Each life crystal requires 6 shards to craft.
